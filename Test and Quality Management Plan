# Comprehensive Test and Quality Management Plan

This document outlines the strategic approach to testing, reporting, and defect management for the project, ensuring that the Non-Functional Requirements (NFRs) are met and validated at every stage.

---

## 1. High-Level Test Strategy

This strategy defines the scope, approach, resources, and schedule of intended testing activities. It is designed to verify that the system meets the quality standards defined in the NFR document.

### 1.1 Testing Levels and Scope

Testing will be conducted across multiple levels, each targeting specific NFRs.

| **Testing Level**     | **Scope and Objectives**                                                                 | **Key NFRs Validated**                          | **Metrics to be Used**                                                                 |
|-----------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Unit Testing          | Verify individual components (e.g., functions, classes) in isolation. Focus on code correctness, logic, and adherence to standards. | NFR-PROD-004 (Code Quality)                     | Code Coverage (â‰¥85%), Cyclomatic Complexity (<10), Halstead Metrics, Unit Test Pass Rate |
| Integration Testing   | Verify the interfaces and interactions between integrated components. Ensure data flows correctly and services communicate as expected. | NFR-PROD-005 (Architecture), NFR-PROD-007 (Interoperability) | Integration Test Pass Rate (100%), API Response Time, Data Consistency Checks           |
| System Testing        | Verify the complete, integrated system against the specified requirements. This is the primary phase for validating end-to-end NFRs. | NFR-PROD-001 (Performance), NFR-PROD-002 (Security), NFR-PROD-003 (Usability) | Response Times, MTBF, SUS Score, Transaction Success Rate, Security Vulnerability Reports |
| User Acceptance Testing (UAT) | Formal testing conducted by end-users to certify the system is fit for purpose and meets business requirements. | NFR-PROD-003 (Usability), NFR-EXT-01 (Regulatory Compliance) | Transaction Success Rate (â‰¥98%), User Feedback, SUS Score (â‰¥75)                         |

### 1.2 Types of Testing

- **Performance Testing**: Load and stress tests to validate NFR-PROD-001. Metrics include response times, throughput (TPS), and resource utilization.
- **Security Testing**: Automated (SAST, DAST) and manual (penetration testing) methods to validate NFR-PROD-002.
- **Usability Testing**: Conducted with representative users to validate NFR-PROD-003 using SUS and task success rate analysis.
- **Automated Regression Testing**: Continuous suite of automated tests to ensure stability. Key metric: Test Coverage Ratio.

### 1.3 Test Environment and Tools

- **Test Environment**: Dedicated, production-like test environment maintained per NFR-K16.
- **Tools**:
  - *Test Management*: Jira, TestRail
  - *Automation*: Selenium, Cypress, Playwright; JUnit/PyTest
  - *Performance*: JMeter, Gatling
  - *Code Quality*: SonarQube
  - *CI/CD*: Jenkins, GitLab CI

## 2. Project Traffic Light Report

Provides a high-level summary of project health for senior stakeholders.

### Sample Project Status Report: Week 32

**Project**: National Digital Identity Platform  
**Reporting Period**: August 11 - August 17, 2025  
**Overall Status**: ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW

| **Area**     | **Status** | **Commentary**                                                                                     | **Trend**         |
|--------------|------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------|
| Schedule     | ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW  | Authentication module is 5 days behind due to third-party integration complexity. Recovery plan in place. | â†“ Deteriorating   |
| Budget       | ðŸŸ¢ GREEN   | 3% under budget. Schedule slippage not yet affecting costs.                                        | â†’ Stable          |
| Quality      | ðŸŸ¡ YELLOW  | Defect Detection Rate higher than projected. Code Coverage at 86% (Target: 85%), Cyclomatic Complexity at 12 (Target: <10). | â†“ Deteriorating   |
| Scope        | ðŸŸ¢ GREEN   | No changes. Requirement Creep at 0%.                                                               | â†’ Stable          |
| Risks        | ðŸ”´ RED     | High-Severity Security Vulnerability (Risk-047) in payment gateway. Patch ETA: August 19.         | â†“ Deteriorating   |

**Key Actions**:
- **Security Team**: Fix Risk-047 by August 19.
- **Dev Team**: Refactor Authentication module to reduce complexity.
- **PMO**: Re-evaluate Q3 milestone timeline.

## 3. Defect Management Process

Outlines the lifecycle of a defect from discovery to resolution.

### 3.1 Defect Lifecycle Stages

- **New**: Logged with reproduction steps, expected vs. actual results, logs/screenshots.
- **Assigned**: Validated by Test Lead, prioritized, and assigned.
- **In Progress**: Developer working on fix.
- **Fixed**: Fix deployed to test environment.
- **In Retest**: Original tester verifies fix.
- **Closed**: Fix verified.
- **Reopened**: Fix failed; defect reassigned.
- **Rejected/Deferred**: Invalid, duplicate, or postponed with justification.

### 3.2 Priority and Severity Levels

**Severity**:
- *1 (Critical)*: Crash, data loss, security breach.
- *2 (High)*: Major functionality loss, no workaround.
- *3 (Medium)*: Minor loss or major issue with workaround.
- *4 (Low)*: Cosmetic/UI issue.

**Priority**:
- *1 (Urgent)*: Immediate fix required.
- *2 (High)*: Fix in next release.
- *3 (Medium)*: Fix if time allows.
- *4 (Low)*: Future release.

### 3.3 Defect Metrics and Reporting

Tracked per NFR-PROD-004:

- **Defect Density**: Total defects / KLOC
- **Defect Detection Rate**: Defects per test phase
- **Defect Resolution Time (MTTR)**: Avg. time to resolve by severity
- **Defect Backlog**: Weekly count of open defects

Weekly reports will include a burn-down chart showing open vs. closed defect trends.
